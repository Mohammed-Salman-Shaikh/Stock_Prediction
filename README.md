# Stock_Prediction
This repository is about Predicting Stock Price of Infosys with atmost accuracy using Linear Regression.

Here I've used API(Application Programming Interface) from twelvedata.com so that whenever our Linear Regression model tries to predicts the values. We shall be working with real world updated data. 

If you wish to run the program, first you'll need a api key from twelvedata.com, You can get your free API key on twelvedata.com.
I'll be disabling my api key for security purposes.
Download the .ipynb file and run in your colab notebook.
